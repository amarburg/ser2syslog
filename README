This is ser2syslog, a program for reading data from the serial 
port and forwarding it to syslog.   It was created by drastically
stripping functionality out of ser2net.  The first versions
will not be built with configuratbility in mind.

Where files are used unedited, the original ser2net copyright and
headers are retained.  When files are changed, a ser2syslog copyright
has been added.
